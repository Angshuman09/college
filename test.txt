 Managing your personal book collection: Let's assume you have a large collectin of books in your home. To track the 
 details of the books and their availablity status(eg. to whom and when you lent it), you want to maintain a digital record.
 To start with this project, following preliminaries are to bre done:

 - Decide on the record structure(eg. which data structure(s) to use, what fields to keep, what will be the unique field etc.)

 - write a file handling program(s) to do the following:

      > Add new records of books
      > Search for books using various criteria(like ISBN, Book name, Author etc.)
      > Modify the detail of existing book records

 Also add a simple menu so user can easily interect with it.
